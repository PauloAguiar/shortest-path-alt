/**
 * A consistent (and therefore admissible) A* heuristic for one search: a lower bound on the
 * remaining cost from any node to the target set, so the search can prefer nodes heading toward
 * the target instead of flooding a Dijkstra disc in every direction. Guarantees identical costs
 * to the uninformed search — only the exploration order (and size) changes.
 * <p>
 * Shape: {@code h(n) = min(chebyshev2D(n, targetBox), floor)} where {@code targetBox} is the 2D
 * bounding box of all target tiles and {@code floor} is the cheapest possible "jump" toward that
 * box. The floor is what keeps teleports from breaking admissibility: without it, a node 2000
 * tiles away would get h = 2000 even though a teleport could cover that for 8 units.
 * <p>
 * The floor is the minimum, over the transports this search can actually use, of
 * {@code max(0, duration + configured weight) + chebyshev2D(landing, targetBox)} — restricted to
 * transports that are true <em>shortcuts</em>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Origin-less (global) teleports — castable from anywhere, always included.</li>
 * <li>Origin-bound transports whose 2D displacement exceeds their cost (spirit trees, gliders,
 * long agility shortcuts). A ladder or door moves less than it costs, and the walking term
 * already lower-bounds any path through it (triangle inequality: reaching its origin costs at
 * least the origin's own chebyshev distance), so it cannot constrain the floor. This matters:
 * a ladder right at the target would otherwise collapse the floor to ~2 and neuter the
 * heuristic for the whole map.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Consistency argument (h(a) &le; edge(a,b) + h(b) for every edge kind): walking moves 1 tile per
 * unit so the box distance changes by at most the edge cost; a non-shortcut transport edge is
 * covered by the triangle inequality above; a shortcut transport edge T satisfies
 * {@code floor <= effCost(T) + chebBox(dest(T))} by the floor's own definition; and abstract
 * (global-teleport hub) nodes take {@code h = floor}, which every tile's h is already &le; and
 * every teleport landing's term is already &ge;. Consistent h means the first settle of a state
 * is optimal — the engine needs no reopening.
