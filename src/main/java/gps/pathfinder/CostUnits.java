/**
 * The pathfinder's cost currency, normalized to real time: one unit is the time a RUNNING player
 * takes to cover one tile — half a game tick (0.3 seconds). A walking edge costs its tile distance
 * (unchanged), and a transport's travel time in game ticks converts at {@link #UNITS_PER_TICK}
 * units per tick, so both kinds of edge are priced in the same wall-clock currency.
 * <p>
 * With no configured weights a path's cost IS its ETA ({@code units × 0.3s}), so routes ordered by
 * cost are ordered by estimated time. The per-method config weights are preference modifiers in
 * this same currency — positive disfavors a method, negative favors it — never a different unit,
 * which is what keeps the ordering consistent with the displayed ETAs.
