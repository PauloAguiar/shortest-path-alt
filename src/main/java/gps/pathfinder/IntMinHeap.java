	 * tile on any optimal corridor shares the same f, so f-only ordering explores that whole
	 * plateau breadth-first — for a long walk that is the entire diamond of equal-cost grid paths
	 * (hundreds of thousands of tiles) — before the target can pop. Preferring the higher g among
	 * equal f always advances the deepest node (the one closest to the goal), so the search dives
	 * down one corridor and reaches the target having settled little beside it. Any tie-break
	 * among equal f is optimality-neutral under a consistent heuristic.
	 * <p>
	 * The final id (creation order) tie-break keeps the claims of same-f same-g tiles mirroring
	 * the FIFO search's (cardinals are generated first), which produces the long straight runs
	 * that match the game's own click-walk movement, and makes searches fully deterministic.
