/**
 * A consistent (and therefore admissible) A* heuristic for one search: a lower bound on the
 * remaining cost from any node to the target set, so the search prefers nodes heading toward the
 * target instead of flooding a Dijkstra disc in every direction. Guarantees identical costs to the
 * uninformed search — only the exploration order (and size) changes.
 * <p>
 * Backed by a per-generation {@link DistanceField} (one multi-source reverse flood from the target
 * set over walking edges and reversed origin-bound transports): {@code h(n) = min(field(n), floor)}
 * where {@code floor} is the cheapest jump this search's own usable origin-less teleports offer —
 * {@code max(0, duration + configured weight) + field(landing)}. The floor is what keeps global
 * teleports from breaking admissibility (a node 2000 tiles away is 8 units from the target if a
 * teleport lands there), and computing it per search from the search's post-exclusion availability
 * makes the heuristic STRONGER exactly when searches get expensive: excluding the good teleports
 * raises the floor.
 * <p>
 * Consistency argument (h(a) &le; edge(a,b) + h(b) for every edge kind): walking and origin-bound
 * transport edges satisfy the field's own shortest-path triangle inequality (their reversed edges
 * are inside the flood); a global-teleport edge from the abstract hub to a landing satisfies
 * {@code floor <= effCost + field(landing)} by the floor's definition; abstract hub nodes take
 * {@code h = floor}, which every tile's h is already &le;. Unflooded (reverse-unreachable) tiles
 * also take the floor — reaching a target from them requires a global teleport, which is exactly
 * what the floor bounds. Consistent h means the first settle of a state is optimal — the engine
 * needs no reopening. There is no weak regime to gate against: a flat field-heuristic implies a
 * genuinely cheap route, and therefore a small search anyway.
